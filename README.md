# Hedera Collection Creator Client

This is a simple client for creating NFT collections on Hedera. It is written in Typescript and uses the [Hedera Hethers SDK](https://docs.hedera.com/hethers)

- Note: To Create a Collection you must send 50Hbar to the createCollection Function. This is what HTS requires to create a nft token.
